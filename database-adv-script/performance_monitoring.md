# üìà Database Performance Monitoring & Refinement

## Objective
Continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans and making schema adjustments.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring Query Performance
- Use SQL commands like `SHOW PROFILE`, `EXPLAIN`, or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to monitor query performance.
- Example:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM Bookings WHERE user_id = 123;
SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY 1;
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Bottlenecks
- Look for full table scans, high I/O, or slow query times in the execution plan.
- Common bottlenecks:
  - Missing indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY
  - Large tables without partitioning
  - Inefficient queries (e.g., using SELECT * instead of specific columns)

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Suggested Changes
- Add indexes to frequently filtered or joined columns (e.g., user_id, property_id)
- Partition large tables by date or other logical keys
- Refactor queries to select only needed columns

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing Changes
- Example: Add an index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON Bookings(user_id);
```
- Example: Partition Bookings table (see partitioning.sql)

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting Improvements
- After implementing changes, rerun `EXPLAIN` or `SHOW PROFILE` to compare performance.
- Improvements may include:
  - Reduced query execution time
  - Lower I/O and CPU usage
  - More efficient query plans (e.g., using indexes, partition pruning)

## üí° Conclusion
Regularly monitoring and refining your database ensures it stays fast and efficient as your data grows! üöÄ
