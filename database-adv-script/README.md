# üìö Database Advanced Scripts

Welcome to the Database Advanced Scripts project. This directory contains SQL scripts and documentation for advanced database concepts, including joins, subqueries, aggregations, indexing, partitioning, and performance optimization.

## üöÄ What You'll Find Here
- `joins_queries.sql`: Examples of INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOINs (with comments for learning)
- `subqueries.sql`: Correlated and non-correlated subquery examples
- `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`: Aggregation and window function queries (COUNT, RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
- `database_index.sql`: Index creation scripts for query optimization
- `partitioning.sql`: Table partitioning by date for large datasets
- `perfomance.sql`: Query optimization and performance analysis
- `performance_monitoring.md`: Guide to monitoring and refining database performance
- `optimization_report.md`, `partition_performance.md`, `index_performance.md`: Reports on performance improvements

## üí° How to Use
1. Review the SQL scripts for examples and explanations.
2. Run the scripts in your SQL environment (MySQL syntax used in most examples).
3. Check the markdown files for performance tips and reports.
4. Use the comments in each file to deepen your understanding!

## üìù Learning Outcomes
- Understand and apply different types of SQL joins
- Write and use subqueries (correlated and non-correlated)
- Use aggregation and window functions for data analysis
- Optimize queries with indexes and partitioning
- Monitor and refine database performance
