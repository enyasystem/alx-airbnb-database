-- üéØ Objective: Partition the Bookings table to optimize queries on large datasets

-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Partition the Bookings table by start_date (RANGE partitioning by year)
-- Note: Partitioning syntax may vary by SQL dialect (example below is for MySQL)
ALTER TABLE Bookings
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(start_date)) (
  PARTITION p2022 VALUES LESS THAN (2023),
  PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
  PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
  PARTITION pmax VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);

-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Test query performance on the partitioned table
-- Example: Fetch bookings in 2023
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Bookings WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';

-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Brief Report
-- Before partitioning, queries on Bookings scanned the entire table, resulting in slow performance for large datasets.
-- After partitioning by start_date, queries that filter by date range only scan relevant partitions, reducing I/O and improving speed.
-- EXPLAIN output should show partition pruning (only relevant partitions are accessed).
