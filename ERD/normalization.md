# ðŸ”„ Database Normalization Summary

This document explains the normalization process for the Airbnb database schema and how 3NF was achieved.

## âœ… First Normal Form (1NF)

All tables:
- Have atomic (indivisible) fields
- No repeating groups or arrays
- Each record is unique via a primary key

## âœ… Second Normal Form (2NF)

- Each table has a single-column primary key.
- No partial dependencies exist, since there's no composite key.
- All non-key attributes are fully dependent on their respective primary keys.

## âœ… Third Normal Form (3NF)

- All non-key columns are only dependent on the primary key.
- No transitive dependencies observed.
- Foreign keys (`host_id`, `property_id`, etc.) are used appropriately.

## ðŸ§  Conclusion

The current database schema is well-normalized and satisfies 3NF. No additional restructuring was necessary.
